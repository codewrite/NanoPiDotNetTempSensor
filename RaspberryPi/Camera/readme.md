# Camera Stuff

- Run camera1.py to take a single image
- Run cam2.py to record 5x 30 sec clips of video
- Run convert.sh to convert video to MP4 so it can be played on Windows more easily (requires MP4Box to be installed - `sudo apt-get install gpac`)
- Run stream-video.py to allow video to be accessed on Raspberry Pi port 8000 (i.e. http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8000)
